## why did I do this project?
I took on this project as a way to learn and grow in web development. I wanted to use the MERN stack to build a strong website with features like user login, secure payments, order tracking, and an admin panel. My goal was to make online shopping easier and safer for users while giving myself the opportunity to learn and improve my technical skills. I also find it really rewarding to tackle challenging problems and find practical solutions that enhance the user experience, which is a big part of why I chose this project to learn and develop my abilities.
